# An-Application-Using-Angular-Forms
Here I created an application using Angular Forms &amp; table. In this application there is Registration Form, Login Form. Also we can add data of an inquiry form in an tabular format on frontend and also save to the database. This data can be deleted on button click from database and it will reflect on web browser.
